    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p> Hi! Thanks for visiting my website! I am a recent graduate of Iowa State University with a bachelors of science in software engineering. 
        I recently found out that Github has free web hosting and I thought this would be a fun side project to create where I can record my favorite projects and show off my skills.
